# Memory System (v2)

This directory uses a layered memory architecture:
- raw/       Original conversation captures or minimal audit traces
- episodes/  Task- or topic-bundled summaries
- semantics/ Structured stable facts (identity, rules, security)
- themes/    High-level thematic clusters
- skills/    Memory process and extraction rules

Legacy linear logs have been archived under:
- /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace/memory_archive/20260209T020218Z/
