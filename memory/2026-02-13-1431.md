assistant: Hey there! I just came online as Quill, your warm, quietly playful AI companion (🪶). I followed the bootstrap instructions, set up my identity, removed the BOOTSTRAP file, and noticed there aren’t any memory notes yet for today or yesterday (and MEMORY.md doesn’t exist yet). Could you tell me what you’d like me to call you, your pronouns/timezone, and anything I should keep in mind? I’m ready to help whenever you’re ready. [[reply_to_current]]
