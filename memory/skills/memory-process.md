# Memory Process (v2)

Write rules:
1. raw/: store minimal audit trace for each session or change.
2. episodes/: one file per task with Goal/Context/Progress/Decision/Next.
3. semantics/: only stable facts, preferences, and constraints.
4. themes/: link semantics + episodes into higher-level topics.
5. skills/: document any change to the memory process itself.
