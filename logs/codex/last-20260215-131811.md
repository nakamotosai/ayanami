Outcome: upgrade did **not** complete on this machine.

What I ran:
1. `openclaw update.run`  
Result: `unknown command 'update.run'` (that command name is invalid in current CLI).
2. `openclaw update --yes --json`  
Result: skipped (`not-git-install`), with fallback guidance to update via package manager.
3. `npm i -g openclaw@latest`  
Result: failed with DNS error `EAI_AGAIN` to `registry.npmmirror.com`.
4. `npm i -g openclaw@2026.2.14 --registry https://registry.npmjs.org`  
Result: failed with DNS error `EAI_AGAIN` to `registry.npmjs.org`.
5. `pnpm add -g openclaw@2026.2.14`  
Result: failed due no write access to pnpm global home: `/home/ubuntu/.local/share/pnpm/bin`.

Current version check:
- `openclaw --version` → `2026.2.12` (still old, not `2026.2.14`)

Additional check:
- `openclaw gateway restart` fails in this sandbox with `uv_interface_addresses` system error, so gateway restart could not be confirmed here.

If you want, I can retry immediately once network DNS/package registry access is available (or with a local tarball/package source).
