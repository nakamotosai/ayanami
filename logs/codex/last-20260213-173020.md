**TL;DR**
Security-first OpenClaw installs sit on a dedicated machine, use Tailscale-only networking, and run from an allowlisted command set plus read-only tokens to keep secrets safe. (Source 1)
OpenClaw Browser Skills can cut 30-minute manual doc/monitoring/extraction tasks down to about two minutes while providing a command tutorial and security checklist. (Source 5)

**Practical Tips**
- Host OpenClaw on a dedicated machine so the agent cannot touch your primary device or day-to-day secrets. (Source 1)
- Route all access through Tailscale and avoid exposing public ports to keep inbound connections tightly controlled. (Source 1)
- Allowlist every command the agent can run to shrink the attack surface of hallucinated instructions. (Source 1)
- Issue read-only tokens and enforce one-way data flows so the agent can pull data without pushing sensitive material back out. (Source 1)
- Use OpenClaw Browser Skills to automate API-document harvesting instead of spending 30 minutes on it manually. (Source 5)
- Set a Browser Skill to handle competitor monitoring so you get updates without hopping between sites. (Source 5)
- Deploy Browser Skills for broader web-content extraction workflows, cutting similar jobs down to roughly two minutes. (Source 5)
- Review the bundled command tutorial and security guidance before running a new Browser Skill to avoid misconfigurations. (Source 5)
- Follow the screenshot-based subscription-to-configuration guide to make sure you don’t skip any onboarding steps. (Source 8)

**Pitfalls**
- Running OpenClaw on a shared machine risks leaking secrets across other workloads. (Source 1)
- Exposing public ports instead of using Tailscale undermines the one-way, allowlisted defense model. (Source 1)
- Giving the agent unrestricted command access invites it to execute unintended operations if it hallucinates. (Source 1)
- Skipping the Browser Skill security guidance while automating document parsing can open new data-exposure paths. (Source 5)
- Racing through setup without the step-by-step guide risks missing critical configuration details. (Source 8)

**Recommendation**
Lock down the deployment with Source 1’s checklist (dedicated host, Tailscale-only networking, allowlisted commands, read-only tokens) before layering in Source 5’s Browser Skills automation, and keep Source 8’s subscription-to-configuration walkthrough nearby while finishing the actual setup.

**Next Steps**
1. Revisit the Source 1 article to catalogue every security control it recommends. (Source 1)
2. Explore Source 5’s Browser Skills tutorial and security notes before authoring new skills. (Source 5)
3. Step through the Source 8 screenshot guide during subscription and configuration to catch any missed steps. (Source 8)
